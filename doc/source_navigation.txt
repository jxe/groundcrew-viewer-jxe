/lib/
  This part is organized into architectural levels. We have some foundational
  javascript utilities and css conventions in jswebkit/, then we have an
  API for dealing with groundcrew objects like agents and ideas in gcapi/
  built on top of that.

        also forms receive the behaviour that they become disabled and a
        specified function is called in the current app before it's action
        results in the viewer going to that location.

    + item - defines yet another item
      A word about action tags and upfors:

      So when a user signs up, they indicate some very specific kinds of
      things they are into.  As specific as "knitting" or "streetcorner
      oddities and fun" and "pick-up soccer games".  These become atags (for
      "action tags").  They are abbreviated, for example to "knitting",
      "cornerfun", and "soccer".

      But when a user gets in touch from their phone, they say something more
      vague.  Something like "i want adventure" or "connection" or
      "volunteering".  These more vague words are called "upfor" tags.  These
      are the things that appear on the badges.  There is no hierarchical
      relationship between atags and upfors.  It is many to many.  A bipartite
      graph.  And the current upfors of an agent select a subset of their
      atags which are currently in effect.

      # atag_to_upfors: translates action tags to upfors.
      # calculate_fields:
        takes an item as argument
        calculates the given item's fields.
      # calculated_fields:
        defines what fields to calculate, available field names/functions are:
        upfor, wants, time_avail, readywords, locked, map_icon, thumb_url,
        availability_status.

    + models - defines model objects
      The Resource class is extended by groundcrew-specific functionality.
      # Resource.prototype.in_city:
        takes a city and additional options to the resource's find function
        as arguments.
        returns all resources in the given city.
      # Resource.prototype.with_atag:
        takes an action tag as argument.
        returns all resources with given action tag.
      # Agent:
        defines a new resource of agents and also enhancer and changed
        functions.
      # Landmarks and Ideas:
        define new resources of landmarks/ideas.




/app/

    The viewer is organized into multiple modes to be found in /app/modes.
    apps provide their services and link to each other using an internal URL
    structure. For example, a command like Viewer.go('/share/add') will run
    some code in /app/modes/share/share.js which will open a window to
    specify a resource you want to share.
    You can also call functionality directly in the browser by using
    /viewer.html#/<app>/<argument>{/<arguments>}.
